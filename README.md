# Shared To-do
A college project to exercise development and deployment of a real application


## Some questions
- If we define a CMD in a container that starts a server, but we added more dependencies so this command can work, how does the container install the dependencies if the install command is defined in lower layers of the dockerfile?
- If we this same command failes, how do we fix this failure when we have no access to the container?

## TODO 
- [x] Expose port from container 
- [x] Create container for DB
- [x] Make files editable from outside of container (--user 1000:1000)
- [] Make the same as above with docker-compose
- [] Research on security of above
